"""Picture → word and listen → meaning: the exercises that ask what a word is.

A distractor is another studied word that no learner could fairly take for the right one: not of
the same root (شَجَر beside شَجَرَة), not spelled the same, not sharing a content word of its meaning
in either language (قَلْب "srce" beside فُؤَاد "srce"), not drawn with the same picture, and not a
near-synonym the Nuances section groups with it.

A picture is vaguer than a word: an emoji of grapes is also "fruit", a glass of milk also "a drink",
a calf's face also "a cow", a raincloud also "water", a sun also "a day". So a picture's distractors
come from other kinds of things altogether — never its own category, nor one a picture of it could
pass for (CONFUSABLE_CATEGORIES). A word heard is asked among words of about the same frequency.

Pure: the words are passed in.
