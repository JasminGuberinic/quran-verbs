description: Add the next batch of 25 verbs to the Fiʿl study site, token-efficiently. Use when the user says "/fil-batch 26-50", "next batch", "dodaj još glagola", or asks to add verbs to the site.

# Add a batch of verbs (Arabic + English + Bosnian)

Goal: about 400 verbs (88% of verb occurrences in the Quran), 25 per batch, one batch per
conversation. Arabic quality is the point; every printed line costs tokens, so work from
the compact files and read only what a step needs.

## Rules
- Start a **new conversation** per batch. Don't re-read docs or code you don't need.
- Use `.venv/bin/fil batch …` only. It prints failures and one-line summaries; never `cat` large files.
- Only **bs + en** in a batch. The other 14 languages fall back to English until a bulk
  translation pass (see "Later" below).
- Don't make product decisions alone; ask the user (in Bosnian, briefly).
- Commit when the batch is done; never push.

## Steps
1. `fil batch plan FROM TO` → `build/batch/plan.tsv` (job, the form to write, cell),
   `todo-meanings.tsv`, `todo-ayah.tsv`. (Already run for 26–50.)
2. `fil batch wordbank` → `build/batch/wordbank.tsv`: words whose glosses already passed the
   gate. Build sentences from these first; check any new word with `service.lookup_word`.
3. Meanings: write `build/batch/meanings.tsv` (`root_form  en  bs`), then `fil batch meanings …`.
   English should use a word the CAMeL lexicon glosses (it is checked); Bosnian natural.
4. Ayah verbs: write `build/batch/ayah.tsv` (`s:a:w  en  bs`) — the verb *as it stands in that
   ayah*, with its clitics and object pronouns — then `fil batch ayah …`.
5. Sentences: write `build/batch/draft-N.tsv`, one per line:
   `job<TAB>arabic words, target marked *<TAB>en<TAB>bs<TAB>en glosses|…<TAB>bs glosses|…`
   Short (2–4 words), natural MSA, full harakat, standard spelling (not Uthmani). Use the
   plan's form for the verb. Never put invented words in God's mouth; avoid first-person
   speech that only God says in the Quran (hand such a job to a human instead).
   `fil batch draft build/batch/draft-N.tsv` → fix only the FAIL lines and rerun them.
6. Blind review: `fil batch review-export`, then one general-purpose agent (strong model)
   reads `build/batch/blind.json` and writes verdicts JSON (same prompt shape as before:
   grammar_ok, translation_ok, verb_usage_ok, approved, note; judge en + bs only; no code).
   `fil batch review-import <verdicts.json>`; repair REFUSED ones, export/review again with
   a *fresh* agent (a reader who saw the first draft is no longer blind).
7. `fil site`, `pytest -q`, `node --test tests/js`, commit, publish the artifact
   (see project memory for how the artifact copy is made).

## Known gate behaviour (saves repair loops)
- English glosses are compared in base form; prefer lexicon words (e.g. "wished, willed" for شَاءَ).
- Hamzat-wasl imperatives are confirmed by the corpus table — that is expected, not a failure.
- Documented lexicon gaps live in `data/gloss_exceptions.json` (add one only with a reason).

## Later: the other 14 languages (several batches at once)
Build a translation memory (each unique word glossed once per language), export compact
TSV, one cheaper-model agent per language (Sonnet), import with a validating script.
